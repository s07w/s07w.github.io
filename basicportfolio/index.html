			<p> <img src="assets/images/sw.jpg" class="selfie"> Nice to meet you! I'm Sam. I currently live on the West Side of
				Cleveland and work in Cleveland midtown. I hold a Master's in Professional & Technical communication, and
				it has afforded me the ability to be intensely detail-oriented while never losing sight of the big picture. I'm
				currently enrolled in a coding class at Case Western Reserve University and am excited to expand these skills and
				take them in a new, forward-looking direction. I am fastidious and hold myself to rigorous standards in not only
				providing quality work, but work that maintains a sense of humanity. I've found that material with authentic
				personality isn't something easy to come by. I value a respectful honesty in what can and can't be done, and am
				always looking for ways to finagle a solution despite the obstacles. 
			<br><br>
				Avocationally, I love music. I'm either combing the internet for new music, writing songs, or trying to figure out
				how to play a song. I always appreciate the solitude and perspective that a hike can provide. I'm a lifelong Browns
				fan. Hopefully that demonstrates some tenacity, if not some blind
				optimism. But it's all about striking a balance, isn't it? I don't think there's anything wrong with being an
				idealist, so long as one has a realistic compass.</p>
