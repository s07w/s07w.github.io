    <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p>This is my Github Pages Page. There's so much that I find weird and unfamiliar, but I'm excited to keep
            going and see how much I can learn. I feel like that might be unending, but I'm honestly pretty excited at
            the prospect. Bear with me as I make one million weird/stupid/scrub decisions.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>and enjoy!</p>
